Note:
I think the ship turned out pretty well, I wish I could have made the monster look better than it turned out. Make sure you check out the details of the ship, like the lookout station, the steering wheel, the ropes, and the new textures. Also make sure you hit space to fire the cannons. I wanted to add fog, but it would cause massive fps drops and it wouldn't interact with the water well, so I have that commented out. Finally, not project related, but I really enjoyed the class, thanks for a fun semester!
